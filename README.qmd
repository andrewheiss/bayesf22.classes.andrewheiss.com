## How to build the site

1. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) version 2022.07.1 or later since it has a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installation embedded in it. Otherwise, download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) separately.
2. Open `bayesf22.Rproj` to open an [RStudio Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3. If it's not installed already, R *should* try to install the [{renv} package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) when you open the RStudio Project for the first time. If you don't see a message about package installation, install it yourself by running `install.packages("renv")` in the R console.
4. Run `renv::restore()` in the R console to install all the required packages for this project.
5. Run `targets::tar_make()` in the R console to build everything.
6. `r emoji::emoji("tada")` All done! `r emoji::emoji("tada")` The complete website will be in a folder named `_site/`.


## {targets} pipeline

We use the [{targets} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to build this site and all its supporting files. The complete pipeline is defined in [`_targets.R`](_targets.R) and can be run in the R console with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
targets::tar_make()
```

The pipeline does a few major tasks:

- **Run long-running Bayesian scripts**: Bayesian computation with MCMC sampling takes a long time. Instead of running our models in `.qmd` files that are re-run when rendering the website, we run them in separate `.R` files (located in [`R/`](R/)) and show their results in their corresponding `.qmd` files.

- **Build Quarto website**: This project is a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which compiles and stitches together all the `.qmd` files in this project based on the settings in [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml). See the [Quarto website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for more details.

The complete pipeline looks like this:

<small>(This uses [`mermaid.js` syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) and should display as a graph on GitHub. You can also view it by pasting the code into <https://mermaid.live>.)</small>

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# Make sure there are newlines between the code block boundaries and the output
# from `workflow`, which also needs to be separated by newlines
cat("``` mermaid\n")
cat(workflow_graph, sep = "\n")
cat("\n```")
```
